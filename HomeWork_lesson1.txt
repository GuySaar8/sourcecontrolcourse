1) Create a job is executing a python script. Python is not mandatory. You can use a bash script as well.
A complex script is wellcome. Requierement of the script is to run with 
at least 2 arguments.
Examples: 
$ some_script.py arg1 arg2
$ another_script.py abs 45 ertttyyyy

2) All these argumets are input parameters in Jenkins job.
3) Build few times with different parameters values.
4) Check the "Consule Output" at the each build and compare with previous builds.
5) Make failure simulations in order to see the build is failed (red):
compilation error, functional error, incorrect input, etc.
5) To improve your job by checking input parameters. To fail the job if number of arguments is more than 2.
